# Ex.1 Cloud Account Setup and Services Overview in Microsoft Azure

# Aim:
To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, IoT, and Security.

# Procedure:
## Step 1: Go to the Azure Website
•	Visit https://azure.microsoft.com

•	Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.
## Step 2: Sign Up with Microsoft Account

•	If you already have a Microsoft account (Outlook/Hotmail), sign in.

•	Otherwise, create a new Microsoft account using your email.
## Step 3: Enter Account Information

•	Provide your basic details such as name, country/region, phone number, and verification details.
## Step 4: Identity Verification

•	Enter your mobile number and verify using OTP (SMS or call).
## Step 5: Select Support Plan

•	Choose the Basic Support Plan (Free) for beginners.
## Step 6: Complete Sign-Up

•	Review details and click Sign Up.

•	You’ll receive a confirmation email and your Azure account will be activated.
## Step 7: Sign In to Azure Portal
•	Go to https://portal.azure.com

•	Sign in with your Microsoft account.

•	This is the main dashboard where you can explore all Azure services.

## Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):
## Secure your Azure account root user
•	Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.

•	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account.
## Create a new administrative user
•	Go to Azure Active Directory (AAD) → Users → New User.
•	Assign a username and set a temporary password.
•	Under Roles, assign Global Administrator or Owner role.
## Sign in as the administrative user
•	Use the newly created credentials to sign in.
•	Change the password on first login.
•	Now use this admin account for everyday tasks (instead of root).
## Services Overview in Azure:
Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:
## 1.	Compute Services
•Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Managed Kubernetes for containerized applications.

•Azure Container Instances (ACI): Run containers without managing servers.

•Azure Batch: Large-scale parallel and high-performance computing jobs.

•Azure Virtual Desktop: Windows desktop and app virtualization in the cloud.

•Azure Service Fabric: Microservices and container orchestration platform.

## 2.	IoT Services
•	Azure Sphere: End-to-end security for IoT devices (hardware, OS, and cloud).

• Azure Time Series Insights: Fully managed analytics, storage, and visualization for IoT telemetry.

• Azure Maps: Location-based services and geospatial analytics.

• Device Provisioning Service (DPS): Automated device registration to IoT Hub at scale.
## 3.	Security Services
 • Azure Security Center (integrated with Defender for Cloud): Continuous security assessment and recommendations.

 • Azure DDoS Protection: Mitigates distributed denial-of-service attacks.

 • Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): Identity and access management for users and applications.

 • Azure Firewall: Managed, cloud-based network security firewall.

 • Azure Bastion: Secure, seamless RDP/SSH access to VMs without exposing public IPs.

 • Azure Information Protection (AIP): Classify and protect sensitive documents and emails.
